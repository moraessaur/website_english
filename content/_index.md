subtitle: "Data scientist, MSc and BSc in genetics."
description: |
  I am a former researcher turned data scientist. My data science journey started back in 2009 when I did research for my undergraduate project with bioinformatics. During that time I learned a wide array of techniques, all of which are foundational for today's data science stack.
  <br><br>
  I have a proven track record as an academic in the form of scientific publications and also built models with quantified ROI as a data scientist for industry. I am very fond of creating transparent and reproducible data pipelines, with the goal of making results and methods accessible and comprehensive to all.
  <br><br>
  My main assets revolve around developing predictive and segmentation models, data pipelines and creating statistically robust metrics for businesses.
