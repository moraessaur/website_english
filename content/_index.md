title: "Lucas Moraes"
subtitle: "Data scientist, MSc and BSc in genetics."
description: "
I am a former researcher turned data scientist. My data science journey started back in 2009 when I did research for my undergraduate project using bayesian inference. During that time I learned a wide array of techniques still very important in data science.
<br><br>
I am very fond of creating transparent and reproducible data pipelines, with the goal of making results and methods accessible and comprehensive to all.
<br><br>
In this personal website, I explain my career with a little more depth and make my contact available. [A straightforward version of my cv can be acessed here](https://www.lucasmoraes.io/cv/).
